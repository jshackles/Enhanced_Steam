<li><b>Thank you everyone for your years of support</b>
<li>This marks the end of Enhanced Steam, however <a href='https://es.isthereanydeal.com/'>my friends at IsThereAnyDeal made a fork and are continuing development</a>!
<li>Fixed an issue with custom steam wallet amounts not processing correctly
<li>Fixed a bug with search filtering boxes not expanding properly
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the Enhanced Steam menu not to function correctly
<li>Removed all features that relied on the Enhanced Steam API server, RIP :(
